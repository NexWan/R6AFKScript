# R6AFKScript
This project is just a java file for the GUI and a python script, at the moment is not working lol
it does work on the desktop but doesnt work in game(thats fucked up)
might fix it later, just leaving it here.
How it works:
  With the gui u give it 2 values as input, it generates a config.txt file that the python script reads and uses pyautogui to move the mouse
  (thats what doesnt work) i need to switch it up to another lib of python that works better or just figure out how to make it work
  im just glad it actually can run the python script and can read the config file.
